            <p>A total over 4.4 million nonfatal work related injuries per year were reported in the private industry
                workplaces. This indicates a rate of 5 work related injuries per 100 full-time workers. According to the
                Bureau of Labor Statistics, the rate of work related injuries decreased from 5.3 cases per 100 workers,
                while the decline is a result of a decrease in reporting as well as a decrease in the number of hours
                worked.</p>

            </div>
            <p>In the event of a work accident, a prompt reporting of the injury is of essence. Prompt reporting will
                ensure that the injured worker receives the right medical attention as well as the needed support at the
                most appropriate time. The sooner the work injury is treated, the sooner the worker is able to return to
                work and the less complications arise with worker’s compensation payments.</p>

            </div>
            <p>If you are a worker who has sustained injuries while at work, it is advisable to consult an attorney
                immediately after the accident. The more time passes, the more rights you may be waiving unwillingly. At
                the same time, it is best to speak with your attorney before you speak with insurance agents, adjusters
                or the company’s attorney.</p>

            <h3>THE INSURANCE GAP</h3>
            <p>In many cases, insurance companies will offer to pay for <strong>medical bills</strong> without questions
                asked. However, most injured workers don’t feel comfortable asking for additional money to cover
                <strong>pain, suffering or loss of work</strong>.
