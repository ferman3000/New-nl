                <h3>THE LOGISTICS OF NEGLIGENCE</h3>
                <p>A high percentage of traffic crashes and deaths involve big rig trucks. A large big rig truck is any
                    truck whose vehicle weight is over 10,000 pounds. Because of their size, crashes involving big rig
                    trucks are more likely to result in serious injury and death than are car crashes. Approximately 10%
                    of all those injured in a big rig truck crash will die. Bigrig trucks are more likely to be involved
                    in multiple-vehicle crashes than are passenger cars. </p>
                <p><strong>Both Federal and state regulations govern trucking</strong> and cover areas such as safety of
                    equipment and hours of the drivers. Trucking companies are required to keep records of such
                    information and it will be necessary to find and research such records. Poor equipment and driver
                    fatigue can be causes of such crashes, and a careful study of the trucking company records may be
                    needed to determine if negligence has occurred.</p>
