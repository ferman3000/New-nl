            <div class="text-block">
                <h3>Did you know that nearly 2% of the American public is bitten by a dog each year?</h3>
                <p>That’s millions of people every year. And almost 800,000 of those are serious enough to require
                    medical attention. Dog bites can result in serious scarring and deformity. Some even result in
                    death. Sadly, the odds that the victim of a fatal dog attack will be a child are 7 out of 10.</p>
                </br>
                <p>An ancient legal rule was the “one bite rule”. This meant that a dog owner was generally not legally
                    responsible the first time their dog bit someone. Most states have replaced this ancient rule with
                    modern dog bite statutes. In fact, many states have imposed ‘strict liability’ on dog owners, even
                    for their dog’s first bite. An owner, as well as a keep or harborer of a dog, maybe liable not only
                    for a dog’s bite but also for other injuries caused by dogs.</p>

            <div class="text-block">
                <h3>OWNER RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
                <p>Pet owners are legally responsible for the behavior of their dogs. In most dog-bite cases, the dog’s
                    owner will be required to pay for the scarring and disfigurement, pain and suffering, and all
                    medical bills and lost wages associated with a dog attack. Most states have statutes making it
                    difficult for dog owners to avoid liability for injuries caused by dog attacks. Sometimes the person
                    taking care of the dog, often called the boarder, keeper or harborer, may also responsible.
                    Unfortunately, a large number of dog bites cause serious injury to small children.</p>

            <div class="text-block">
                <h3>THE REALITY OF SCARRING</h3>
                <p>Scars can be a serious, life-long result of a dog bite. Children are particularly susceptible to
                    bites around the head and face and often suffer disfiguring scarring. Scars are more than physical
                    injuries, also causing emotional injuries and fear. Scars may require plastic surgery which often
                    must wait until the scar matures, usually about a year. In the case of a child, plastic surgery may
                    need to wait until the child is finished growing after puberty. Scarring has a very real impact on
                    self image and can have significant psychological impact.</p>

                <h3>IMMEDIATE ACTIONS</h3>
                <p>As with any accident, there are a number of steps you need to take to ensure everything with your
                    claim goes as smoothly as possible. For your medical problems, see a doctor as soon as possible.
                    Often times, an injury from a dog bite can be underestimated. Get as much information you can about
                    your accident. Key items include the names, numbers and addresses of all the people involved,
                    including witnesses. You will also need to keep track of insurance information and the reporting
                    process. Make copies.</p>
