        problems for the innocent victims.

        ▪ Medical bills, lost wages, disability and physical incapacity, rehabilitation and future health care may seem
        insurmountable obstacles.

    <p class="stats-text">
        ▪ Even figuring out the other driver’s insurance company and amount of insurance coverage can be a major
        problem.
