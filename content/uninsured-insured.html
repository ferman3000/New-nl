                Uninsured motorist coverage is an option available under all automobile insurance policies issued in
                California. If the insured elects to purchase this coverage, the insurance company provides coverage to
                the insured for his or her claims for injuries and damages arising from a motor vehicle accident where
                the party at fault is either uninsured, or does not have enough insurance to provide full compensation
                for the injuries sustained.

            <div class="warning-label">THE HIDDEN AGENDA</div>
            <h3>INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE FOR-PROFIT BUSINESSES</h3>
            <p>
                For this reason, they have an incentive to pay you the lowest amount of compensation for your injuries
                that they can get away with. In attempting to persuade you to accept a <strong>“low-ball”
                    settlement</strong>, some insurance adjusters will try to scare you by telling you that unless you
                accept the amount being offered, you will be required to participate in protracted and complicated
                arbitration proceedings. Sometimes they also will neglect to even tell you that you are entitled to
                damages for pain and suffering (often the largest damages component), in addition to compensation for
                your medical bills.

                <h4>THE ATTORNEY ADVANTAGE</h4>
                <p>It is for this reason that many people pursuing claims under their uninsured motorist coverage retain
                    an attorney to represent them and protect their interests. Now, it is true that if your insurance
                    company disputes the worth of your uninsured motorist claim it can require you to participate in an
                    arbitration proceeding before paying you anything.</p>
                <div class="highlight-box">
                    <p> However, it also is the case that when an insurance company sees that an attorney is involved,
                        it often agrees to pay a <strong>substantially higher amount</strong> than what was first
                        offered, without even going through the arbitration process. If the insurance company still
                        refuses to pay full value
                        on your claim, however, the attorney will then demand arbitration on your behalf and pursue the
                        claim in an arbitration hearing. An experienced attorney is often able to obtain top dollar for
                        his client in an arbitration proceeding.

                <h4>THE REALITY ON THE ROAD</h4>
                <p> All states have laws that require drivers to show proof of their financial ability to pay for
                    personal
                    injury or property damage to others in the event of an automobile accident. Most drivers satisfy
                    this
                    requirement by purchasing insurance, but many cannot afford, or ignore, this obligation. It is also
                    not
                    uncommon for insurance companies to become insolvent, potentially leaving their policyholders
                    without
                    liability coverage. The result is that responsible drivers who carry insurance must bear the burden
                    of
                    paying for their own injuries, or damage to their vehicle, caused by someone who has no insurance
                    coverage.</p>
                <p> Alternatively, some drivers purchase the lowest amounts of liability coverage permitted by the
                    law in their state, which can be insufficient to cover the damages incurred by someone injured in an
                    accident with them. Unfortunately, many people realize the importance of uninsured/underinsured
                    coverage
                    too late, i.e., after they or their family members have been injured by an uninsured or underinsured
                    motorist.</p>
