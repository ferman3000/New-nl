            <p class="med-intro">
                A rapid, sudden change in the movement of the head or neck can result in the brain impacting the inner
                surface of the skull. Such an impact can cause someone to suffer a brain injury. If someone suffers a
                brain injury as a result of the negligence or wrongful conduct of another person or corporation, the
                victim and the victim’s family may be entitled to compensation under California laws. Brain injury cases
                often arise out of auto accidents, truck accidents, defective products, medical malpractice, workplace
                accidents, toxic chemicals, and explosions. The effects of a brain injury can be crippling and
                permanent.

                <p>The brain is a three-pound mass of gray matter enclosed in the cranium. It interprets sensory
                    impulses, coordinates bodily functioning, and is the center of emotion and thought. The brain has
                    three main sections: the cerebral hemispheres, cerebellum and brain stem. There are left and right
                    cerebral hemispheres. They are divided into sections called lobes.</p>

            <h3>THE HUMAN COST: LIFE AFTER INJURY</h3>
            <div class="impact-text-cols">
                <p>After brain injury, things that once were easy and familiar become strange and difficult. A great
                    deal of mental effort is usually required to do things that required little or no effort before the
                    brain injury. Work, school, and personal relationships suffer. The injured party often becomes less
                    efficient at their job and their livelihood is jeopardized.</p>
                <p>Often they become unpredictable, unreliable, and sometimes violent. When the victim of a brain injury
                    is a child, they can develop behavioral problems at home and school. Often they regress to an
                    earlier development state. As you can imagine, a brain injury can affect the entire family.</p>
